          He has a reputation for being the most charismatic man alive, and his
          hedonistic lifestyle, which gave us many great many stories, including
          Maureen from the pub, and Geri Halliwell in a duffle bag. His
          interests include conspiracy theories such as a belief in UFOs and the
          debunked pizzagate conspiracy theory.
